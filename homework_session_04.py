#holymacarony I think I'm going to sleep now, this was so much brainwork, the cheetsheet was big help. Only the "len"-function I had to google, couldnt find a way to get the amount of list-items in another way.
# also I couldn't figure out how to use the hint of the inner angle 180 Ã— (1-2/n), I'm really poor in math and trigonometry and stuff -.-


#2 hours und 2 exercises later I feel so dumb. I could have done it like the one with the input function (exercise 5) and only add +1 side at the end of a loop until hectagon.
#Today I'm not going to try it anymore, I will do it by my own the next days because I'm curious but I leave this here now as it was, sorry for wall of text.
